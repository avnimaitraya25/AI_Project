# AI_Project

We have developed a chatbot designed to provide users with an intuitive interface for managing their smart home ecosystem. This chatbot allows for natural language control of connected devices, aiming to simplify interactions with lighting, temperature, security systems, and more. By understanding user commands, it offers a centralized point of control, enhancing convenience and streamlining the smart home experience.
